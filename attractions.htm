               <p>
                Alexandria, often dubbed "The Pearl of the Mediterranean," is a historic city in northern Egypt. Founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BCE, it has served as a center of learning, culture, and trade for over two millennia. Situated along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, its strategic location facilitated connections between Europe, Asia, and Africa.

                The city boasts a rich tapestry of cultural influences, reflecting its diverse past. From the legendary Library of Alexandria, once the largest repository of knowledge in the ancient world, to the iconic Pharos Lighthouse (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World), remnants of its glorious past still captivate visitors today.
                
                Modern Alexandria is a bustling metropolis, blending ancient heritage with contemporary life.

               <h4>Giza</h4>
               <p>
                Giza, located on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt, is world-renowned for its ancient wonders, particularly the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx. These iconic structures have captured the imagination of people for millennia, standing as testaments to the ingenuity and architectural prowess of ancient civilizations.

                The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops, is the largest of the three pyramids in Giza and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Constructed around 2560 BCE, it served as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu and is composed of millions of limestone blocks.

                Adjacent to the Great Pyramid stands the Pyramid of Khafre, built for Khufu's son, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, the smallest of the three. These pyramids, along with the Great Sphinx, which is believed to have the head of a pharaoh and the body of a lion, form a striking complex that continues to awe visitors with its grandeur and mystery.

                Beyond its ancient wonders, Giza is a bustling city that has grown around these archaeological treasures. It offers visitors a glimpse into Egypt's rich history, with museums, markets, and cultural experiences that complement the awe-inspiring sights of the pyramids and the Sphinx.
